        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML was invented in 1993</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains metadata or machine-readable infromation.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>You use different html tags to build the framework of your webpage.</li>
          <li>The doctype element defines the document type, in this case we are using HTML.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS was invented in 1996</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are the preferred method in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Selectors define the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model - Each HTML element is essentially a box, each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git was invented in 2005</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>To access Git, we use the command line (Git Bash on Windows)</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely (in the cloud)</li>
          <li>A Repository (Repo) is a project on Github, a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history.</li>
          <li>A Branch is a workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Markdown is the way content files are formatted in GitHub, Markdown files use the .md file extension.</li>
          <li>Committing Changes is how you save a new version of a file you are working on, whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit.</li>
          <li>Pull Requests are asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch.</li>
          <li>Merging is when a Pull Request is approved, changes are "pulled in" or merged into the main branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript was invented in 1995</li>
          <li>JavaScript was created in only 10 days!</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a powerful object-oriented programming language commonly used to create interactive effectrs within web browsers.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A variable can hold different types of data like, strings, numbers, booleans, undefined and null and can even contain a mixture of all types as an array. </li>
          <li>JavaScript functions will hold set instructions or blocks of code to be executed whenever they are called so that you do not have to repeatedly type out the same code over and over.</li>
          <li>An IF statement will execute a block of code IF a specified condition is true.</li>
          <li>You can use FOR loops to iterate through an array and use that data a specific way.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
