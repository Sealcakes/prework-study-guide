# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a webpage built as a study resource for my Full Stack Developer bootcamp.  It briefly outlines the prework study material that I learned in creating the webpage.  By creating this webpage I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.  It serves no purpose other than my individual learning and practice.  May it be a template for future web dev learners.
