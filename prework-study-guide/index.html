          <li>The head element contains metadata or machine-readable infromation.</li>

          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>To access Git, we use the command line (Git Bash on Windows)</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely (in the cloud)</li>
          <li>A Repository (Repo) is a project on Github, a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history.</li>
          <li>A Branch is a workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Markdown is the way content files are formatted in GitHub, Markdown files use the .md file extension.</li>
          <li>Committing Changes is how you save a new version of a file you are working on, whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit.</li>
          <li>Pull Requests are asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch.</li>
          <li>Merging is when a Pull Request is approved, changes are "pulled in" or merged into the main branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
